# 🧰 DailyObjects Clone Website

This is a **fully responsive, static website project** created using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It replicates the style and structure of a Daily Object showcase — a website that presents multiple common, everyday-use products such as mugs, water bottles, laptop bags, mobile accessories, and more.

This project is named:  
**`dailyobjects__clone__website`**  
It demonstrates a real-world web development workflow built from scratch **without any libraries, frameworks, or backend technologies**.

## 📖 Project Description

The DailyObjects Clone Website is a front-end focused, object-driven website that highlights how common utility items used in daily life can be presented in a visually structured, clean, and interactive way. This clone was developed as a practice project for mastering core web technologies and front-end logic using:

- Pure **HTML** for structure  
- Pure **CSS** for layout, styling, hover effects, and responsiveness  
- Pure **JavaScript** for DOM interactivity like navigation, scroll behavior, and effects  

All sections of the website are handcrafted, responsive, and lightweight. The purpose was to design and code a functional website clone **without using any frameworks (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, React, Vue, etc.)**, thus allowing full control over the learning process.
